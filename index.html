                    Hello, World! My name is Jessica and here I'm going to talk about some cool things I've done in
                    the past 5 years that were really fun and that I would do again if I have the opportunity. These
                    recent days are not easy to digest because of all of the reasons we already know. So one
                    of the things I like to do is remember all of the fun I had when everything was so-called
                    "normal", and plan for more adventures!

                    <h2>Travel with friends!</h2>
                    <p>
                        What is even better than traveling by yourself? Traveling with friends! I once spent 10
                        awesome days traveling between various destinations with two friends. That was so fun! I
                        know that alone you can go only to the places you are really interested in, and you can do
                        things at your own pace. But it's so good to have people to share these moments with, to
                        laugh together, to face the unknown, to have mistakes and successes, to try good and bad
                        foods.. And there's always some crazy stuff that you can only do "safely" if you have your
                        friends around. We are already dreaming for the next time the world will need to deal with
                        us together again.

                    <p>
                        I remember it as if it was yesterday, I woke up that day determined to go to another country
                        to learn English and to have an adventure. So in the middle of 2016 I went to Ireland,
                        alone, my English knowledge was close to zero, and I stayed there for 1yr and 4 months. The
                        best 16 months of my life. Today I like to think that my life was one before that trip, and
                        another after that. Having the experience to leave your confort zone, being "forced" to
                        communicate in another language, learning the ways of people is something that I
                        wouldn't trade for anything! I want to repeat the whole crazy experience. I'm still
                        living in another country (in the US now) and my English is still not perfect and I don't
                        really think it will ever be, but I think it's good enough to jump to another language
                        in the near future. I wish I could do the same, go to a country and relive the whole experience again. I just
                        can't decide where would be the next destination... France, Italy, Spain,
                        Germany, Russia???
