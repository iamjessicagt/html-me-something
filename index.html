                        Hello, World! My name is Jessica and here I'm going to talk about some cool things I've done in
                        the past 5 years that were really fun and that I would do again if I have the opportunity. These
                        recent days are not being easy to digest because of all of the reasons we already know. So one
                        of the things I like to do is to remember all of the fun I had when everything was so-called
                        "normal", and plan for more adventures!

                        <h2>SINGING AND DANCING ON THE STREETS</h2>
                        <p>
                            Actually, this one wasn't my idea. I was too shy and scared to sing and dance in the middle
                            of the streets. When I was overseas I joined this evangelism group honestly thinking I could
                            make some friends there because they were all almost the same age as me. But I really didn't
                            know what was coming! I had to rehearse plays and perform wearing funny clothes and having
                            my face painted black and white, I had to learn songs to sing in the street in broad
                            daylight, I had to learn choreographies (dancing steps) and perform in the middle of the
                            busiest streets of the cities we went. This was all very scary but also really fun, because
                            first, I wasn't the only one getting embarrassed; second, we were traveling to different
                            countries together (the advantage of being in Europe where things like that are much
                            easier). In the end I had a priceless experience and I miss all that excitement and
                            adrenaline!

                        <h2>LIVE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY AND LEARN THE LANGUAGE</h2>
                        <p>
                            I remember it as if it was yesterday, I woke up that day determined to go to another country
                            to learn English and to have an adventure. So in the middle of 2016 I went to Ireland,
                            alone, my English knowledge was close to zero, and I stayed there for 1yr and 4 months. The
                            best 16 months of my life. Today I like to think that my life was one before that trip, and
                            another after that. Having the experience to leave your confort zone, being "forced" to
                            communicate in another language, learning the ways of the people is something that I
                            wouldn't trade for anything! I want to repeat it! The whole crazy experience. I'm still
                            living in another country (in the US now) and my English is still not perfect and I don't
                            really think it will ever be, but I think it's good enough so I can jump to another language
                            in the near future. I wish I could do the same, go to the country and live it all. I just
                            can't decide where would be the next language and destination... France, Italy, Spain,
                            Germany, Russia???

                        <h2>TRAVEL WITH FRIENDS</h2>
                        <p>
                            What is even better than traveling by yourself? Traveling with friends! I once spent 10
                            awesome days traveling between various destinations with two friends. That was so fun! I
                            know that alone you can go only to the places you are really interested in, and you can do
                            things at your own pace. But it's so good to have people to share these moments with, to
                            laugh together, to face the unknown, to have mistakes and successes, to try good and bad
                            foods.. And there's always some crazy stuff that you can only do "safelly" if you have your
                            friends around. We are already dreaming for the next time the world will need to deal with
                            us together again.
